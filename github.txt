iptables allows configuring the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall

Listing current rules
sudo iptables -L
This will print out a list of three chains, input, forward and output,
like the empty

Adding riles
Firewalls can commonly be configured in one of two ways, either set the default rule
to accept and then block any unwanted traffic with specific rules, or by using the rules to define allowed traffic and blocking everything else. The latter is often the recommended approach, as it allows pre-emptively blocking traffic, rather than having to reactively reject connections that should not be attempting to access your cloud server.

To begin usingÂ iptables, you should first add the rules for allowed inbound traffic for the services you require. Iptables can track the state of the connection, so use the command below to allow established connections continue.

sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
